The project "Developing a stock price movement forecasting system based on sentiment and correlation analysis of views on social media with stock value" is done as my bachelor thesis.
Understanding public sentiment is vital for informed decision-making. In today's digital age, the internet and social media platforms have emerged as crucial sources of diverse opinions. This paper explores the role of social media in enhancing user awareness, particularly in the context of investment decisions within the Tehran Stock Exchange. The research focuses on predicting stock values of select symbols by analyzing sentiment expressed in messages posted on the Telegram social network. The study employs text mining techniques to extract key influential keywords and utilizes artificial neural networks to gauge sentiment within messages. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, the study investigates the feasibility of predicting stock price fluctuations based on social media sentiment analysis. However, the findings suggest that sentiments expressed on social media platforms are not a reliable indicator for predicting stock prices. Consequently, investors should exercise caution when relying on sentiment analysis from social media to inform their stock trading decisions, as such reliance may lead to financial losses.
